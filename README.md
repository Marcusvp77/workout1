# workout1
This is the workout1 assignment

This assignment is going to consider different ways to rank the NBA teams. I will be consider things from simple rankings based on a given observed variable to rankings based on derived indices, such as efficiency, or any other composite index. 

This measure will only be considering the player statistics, not the number of wins and losses of each team, nor the result of any tournaments. 

This workout will be working with data.frames/tibbles and producing plots, but using the packages "dplyr" and "ggplot2".
